Koala is a small Python tool intended to help you build projects written in 
Vala. Koala's goal is to build your projects based on project information 
specified in the JSON format. 

How do I use Koala?

You place a 'build.json' file in your projects root directory, which may contain 
the following fields:

	name		the name of your project
	src-dir		path to the directory containing the source files
	bin-dir		path to the directory where the output should be written
	packages	your included packages (array of strings)
	arguments	additional arguments passed to valac

The following example shows the content of a simple  'build.json' file:

	{
		"name" : "my-project",
		"src-dir" : "./src/",
		"bin-dir" : "./bin/",
		"packages"  : ["gtk+-3.0", "glib-2.0"],
		"arguments" : ["-C"]
	}

Once you created a 'build.json' file, you call Koala from the project's root
directory and it builds all your *.vala files in your source directory.
